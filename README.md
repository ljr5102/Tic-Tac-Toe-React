# Tic-Tac-Toe with React

Since I have not built Tic-Tac-Toe enough times I decided to implement yet another variation of it using React.js!

##Details:
* 2-player game, X moves first.
* Clicking a spot on the board marks it unless the spot is taken.
* Game continues until a winner is declared or the board fills.
